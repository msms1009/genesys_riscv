2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock sys_clock_bufds is created on an inappropriate pin riscv_i/clk_wiz_0/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock sys_clock_bufds is defined downstream of clock sys_diff_clock_clk_p and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out4_riscv_clk_wiz_0_0 and rgmii_rx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out4_riscv_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks rgmii_rx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out4_riscv_clk_wiz_0_0 and rgmii_rx_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out4_riscv_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks rgmii_rx_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT riscv_i/RocketChip/inst/rocket_system/tile_prci_domain/tile_reset_domain_tile/core/original_core/csr/remainder[129]_i_3 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '13' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

Identified 6 RAM32X1D primitives that could be retargeted to RAM32M. Retargeting will save approximately 2 memory LUTs and improve routability. These can usually be achieved using synthesis inference or XPMs. The memories are riscv_i/IO/Ethernet/inst/rx_burst_buf_reg_0_15_24_24,

XDCB-6#1 Advisory
Timing constraint pointing to hierarchical pins  
A timing constraint 'set_false_path' has a single -through that points to hierarchical pins (see constraint position '48' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). With such constraint, it is recommended to have a DONT_TOUCH or KEEP_HIERARCHY on the hierarchical module to avoid the risk of pin names changing during synthesis.
